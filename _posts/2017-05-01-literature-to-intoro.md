Players
[io]
good:
I can develop certified Imp and ProbImp interpreter while reading this.
[CompCert]
good
Audiences would be interested in this the most.
[typeclass]
[alea07]
bad
The code is long.
But you donâ€™t have to understand all of that.
The code is depended on the [typeclass] mechanism.
good
I am to analyze this in some day.
CertCript
good
Most relevant one
bad
Most difficult one.
ProbImp
good
Fewer codes than [alea].

*[[alea07]]: pML, 07.
