# title: "SA = GA"
tag: optimization
summary: GA and SA are the same? I think so, while others might don’t agree. This equivalence hypothesis is my current research topic.

I want to ask: what is exactly an “Ill-formed” problem is. Before tackling the rather difficult question, It would be useful to mention some characteristic of it.  

# To begin with: #

1. SA

- It's like a PA[^pa].

2. GA

- It's like a **revolution**.

- Or else?

* huh?

- good.

[^pa]: particle filter.

*[SA]: Simulated Annealing Method.

*[GA]: Genetic Algorithm.
